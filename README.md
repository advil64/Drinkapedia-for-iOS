# Drinkapedia for iOS (www.drinkapedia.tech)
Inspiration

All of us are very serious athletes, so we constantly use apps on our phones to measure water and sugar consumption, but we found that we had to use various apps that all used the fundamental concept: use an algorithm to calculate daily limits. In addition, soon we will reach the drinking age so it is important to monitor our alcohol consumption. So, we decided to create an application and an accompanying website that compiles all of these separate applications together.

What it does

We use a comprehensive algorithm that calculates the daily limits of an individual based on gender and weight. Then, as the user adds information in the add, the app information page will continue to update showing how much more water, caffeine, and sugar the user can consume to reach the daily limit. Most importantly, it displays the estimated Blood Alcohol Concentration based on inputs and displays if it is safe to drive. The accompanying Website provides information on the app and a short game for your entertainment!

How we built it

We used Xcode and Unity to make the app and the game, respectively. We used Amazon Web Services to host the website with a .tech domain.

What's next for Drinkapedia: The App that's better than Wikipedia

We hope to expand the Apple Watch and android wear, to make it convenient for our users.

(You need a mac with xcode to run this app, hopefully it will be on the appstore as soon as I save up enough money)
